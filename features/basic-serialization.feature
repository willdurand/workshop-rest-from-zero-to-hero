#Feature: Basic Serialization
#    In order to learn JMSSerializerBundle
#    As a developer
#    I need to actually use it
#
#    Scenario: Retrieve HTML content
#        Given I am on "/hello/william"
#        When I reload the page
#        Then I should see "Hello William!"
#        And it should be a "html" content
#
#    Scenario: Retrieve JSON content
#        Given I am on "/hello/william.json"
#        When I reload the page
#        Then it should be a "json" content
#        And it should contain a "name" key whose value is "william"
#
#    Scenario: Retrieve XML content
#        Given I am on "/hello/william.xml"
#        When I reload the page
#        Then it should be a "xml" content
#        And it should contain a user whose "name" is "william"
